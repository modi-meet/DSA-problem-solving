// Bridges in Graph
// A bridge is a connection that, if removed, will make some component unable to reach some other component.
// Return all bridges in the graph in any order.
// Bridge is basically, if removed, will result into two or more components.

/*
Go to each node:
- Enter node 
- assign time & low 
- explore children 
- update low 
- check if edge is bridge 
â†’ return.


We need to keep track of parent, because we don't update low for parent(IMPORTANT).
- if the node is reachable from other path than parent, then it is in the same component.
